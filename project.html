            <h2>A Guide</h2>
            <p></p>
          
            <h2>The Basics</h2>
            <h3>What's Expected and What'll Get You Ejected</h3>
          
            <h2>The Added Attention</h2>
            <h3>Achieving the "Boom" Effect</h3>
            <p>In advertising, the "boom" effect is used to refer to the moment a cannon launches one of its cannonballs creating a resonating boom that captivates its audience indefinitely. This same concept can easily be applied to the way we carry ourselves and dress accordingly. Aside from the essentials listed previously, there are numerous additional style choices to be made that can carry you across the dreaded line between noticeable and forgettable. Let me make it clear that memorable does not mean "flashy". There are a number of low-key additions, as well as some vibrant ones, to your appearance that will get the job done.
          Popular men's style magazine, GQ, does an adequate job at depicting several aspects of ones physical persona that catch the eye and leave an impression. Along with some of my own suggestions, take these suggestions into account when deciding how to dress both professionally and in other environments:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Liven up your shirt and tie combo.</strong> Adding some bold and brash color to either your shirt or tie can significantly help keep those around you attentive to what you have to say. It need not only be color but also material as well. These choices provide a break from mundane colors that can flood offices regularly. Just make sure to rememberthat with every bold color there must also be a muted one.</li>
            <li><strong>White is alright, but go for the colored pocket.</strong> Like already stated, colors play a powerful role on what the eyes notice, and pocket squares can be utilized to provide just that.</li>
            <li><strong>Parting is such sweet sorrow, minus the sorrow.</strong> Growing popular in recent years, the parted-to-the-side hairstyle has led many a businessman and any man for that matter to look clean and polished. If the style itself doesn't play to your tastes, then make sure your own brand of style commands the same level of crispness.</li>
            <li><strong>Frame it up.</strong> Glasses frames that is. For those of us who do not have the defined jawline, a classy pair of glasses can truly add structure and stability to your look.</li>
            <li><strong>Bows are not just for women.</strong> Bow ties have been around for a while, but they haven't been as utilized as they could be. Yes, there is some risk in wearing a bow tie to certain occasions. You need to exercise proper judgement in appropriateness. But if it works, tie it up because they always get a shout out.</li>
          </ul>
          
            <h3>Tying It Up</h3>
            <p>When I got my first bow tie, I had no idea how it even wrapped around my neck. Because I know that it isn't exactly the easiest endeavor, I've created a video with instructions just below:</p>
            <figure class="media">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Kdk6bMKKz-0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </figure>
            <p>The process is as follows:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Drape the bow tie around your neck, under your collar, and grasp the ends.</li>
            <li>Cross the longer end over the shorter end.</li>
            <li>Pass the longer end up through the loop, forming a simple, loose overhand knot.</li>
            <li>Pull the dangling end to the left and then fold it back over itself to the right.</li>
            <li>Drop the raised end of the tie over the front of the bow.</li>
            <li>Grab the left and right sides of the horizontally-folded end and pinch them together in front of the dangling end.</li>
            <li>Feed the middle of the dangling end back through the knot you made in Step 3.</li>
            <li>Tighten the bow by pulling on opposite sides and halves simultaneously. </li>
            <li>Finished.</li>
            </ol>
          
            <h2>Carry It All</h2>
            <p>The last and most crucial piece of the puzzle is confidence. Your suit commands respect, so should the way you carry yourself. Roll your shoulders back. keep your chin up and your spine straight. Know your environment. As long as you have the foresight to know what is appropriate for your work or other occasions, take the reigns and carry yourself well.</p>
